Liveblog: Roma v Benevento
By Football Italia staff
Join us for all the build-up and action as it happens from tonight’s Serie A match, as Roma target fourth place against Benevento.
It kicks off at the Stadio Olimpico at 19.45 GMT. If you are on a mobile device or tablet, then follow the Liveblog HERE.
The Giallorossi ended their dismal run of results last week with a 1-0 win away to Hellas Verona, decided by Cengiz Under in the opening minute.
They haven’t tasted success in front of the home fans since December 16 and a victory here would take them into fourth place, leapfrogging rivals Lazio.
Changes are forced by bans, injuries and Bruno Peres crashing his car, while Benevento can launch more of their January buys, including Bacary Sagna.
