Introducing iPhone 8 (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition, in a stunning red glass finish. Each purchase contributes directly to the Global Fund to support HIV and AIDS programmes. And brings us one step closer to an AIDS-free generation.

Dual 12-megapixel cameras on iPhone 8 Plus let you take studio-quality portraits on your phone.
Both iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are precision-engineered to resist water and dust.
An all-glass back lets you simply set iPhone 8 down on any Qi-certified wireless charging mat to power up — no cables necessary.
A portion of the proceeds from every (PRODUCT)RED™ purchase will go to the Global Fund to fight AIDS in Africa.

Product features may vary by model.

iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are splash, water and dust resistant, and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP67 under IEC standard 60529. Splash, water and dust resistance are not permanent conditions, and resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage is not covered under warranty.
Compatible Qi-certified wireless chargers are sold separately.
