Dear Puneeth,
 
Hope you’re doing great!
 
We pioneered retail for Apple products in the country through our  first flagship store, Imagine, in 2004. We are now pleased to announce the launch of the country’s first online store exclusively for Apple products and allied accessories :

www.imagineonline.store
 
You can now enjoy the premium Imagine experience within the confines of your drawing room, or while you are on the go. The online store features the entire portfolio of Apple products and an extensive range of high-quality accessories, and this will only get bigger and better. You can get your purchases door delivered to your address, or choose to pick it up at the nearest Imagine store. 
 
As in the case of shopping at our stores, all purchases at the online store qualify for iCircle loyalty points that can be accrued and redeemed subsequently either on the online platform or at any of the stores. 
 
Alternately, you can use the platform when you visit any of our 24 retail stores to place orders for items that might not be in-stock. 
 

Come and experience Imagine Online. We would love to hear your experiences.

Watch this space for attractive launch offers !
 
Warm Regards,
