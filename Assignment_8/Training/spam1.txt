The following documents are generally required along with your filled in application form to process your ration card application.

1. Three passport size photographs of head of family attested by a gazetted officer/MLA/MP/Municipal Councilor.

2. Proof of residence. This can be house registration documents, Tax receipts, Major utility bill such as electricity bill or any other proof of residence that is acceptable to the authorities. Tenants for instance could get residency notes from landlord.

3. Once the application and documents are submitted a officer from the Circle office will preform a random check at your residence to confirm the validity of your application. They make a personal visit for this purpose.

4. While the process is supposed to take about 15 days, don't bank on it.
