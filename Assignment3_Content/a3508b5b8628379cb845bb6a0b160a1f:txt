Jurgen Klopp wrapped up his 50th win as Liverpool manager with a 2-0 win over Southampton on Sunday afternoon.
Goals from Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah were enough for Klopp's Liverpool as they strengthened their claims for a place in the Premier League's top four.
Firmino got the Reds off to a flyer when he converted Salah's square pass for his 20th of the campaign on six minutes.

The Brazil international then turned provider with a classy backheel for Salah to net his 29th of the season and double the Reds' advantage.
Some supporters inside St Mary's thought the 30-goal milestone has been reached in the second period, but the Egypt international only found the side netting after Alex McCarthy had denied Firmino.
