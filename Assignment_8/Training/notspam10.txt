Hi Puneeth,

My name is Jay Alammar. I’m a content developer on Udacity’s AI team. I started my career as a coder, but everything changed for me when I discovered AI. I’m writing you today, because I want to encourage you to consider adding AI to your coding toolkit.

No more hand-coded solutions. No more manual fixes for every edge case. Instead, you can train neural networks to learn from more data than we could ever make sense of personally!

This is why I’m excited about Udacity’s new AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. Whether you’ve been programming for a while, or are brand-new to coding, you’ll be able to master all the essential AI tools (Python, linear algebra, neural nets) and start building your own AI apps in just two months.

Best of all, if you enroll by April 3, you can even save on your tuition!

Every developer and analyst will need these skills in the next decade. You have a chance to get started today.

Best,

Jay
