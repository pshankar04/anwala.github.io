At Trulia, we are constantly working to improve our products and services so we can help you discover a place you’ll love to live. In that effort, we want to share our updated Terms of Use and Privacy Policy with you. The new Terms of Service and Privacy Policy have been published on Trulia and will go into effect for existing users on April 20, 2018. By continuing to use our services and apps after this date, you agree to the updated terms.

Below are some of the key changes:
We’ve included information on new services and apps now offered by Trulia. This includes information about our collection and use of personal information connected to those new services as well as ways we use data to help improve content and products for you.
We’ve added details on the procedures and requirements of paid services offered by Trulia.
We’ve clarified the rights granted through Trulia's services, including what you are and are not allowed to do on our platforms.
We’ve provided information about how we respond to government and other legal requests for user data.
Because the above revisions are just the highlights, we encourage you to read through the fully updated Terms of Use and Privacy Policy to make sure you understand the changes and how they affect you. Other than that, no need to do anything further.

Thank you for being a part of the Trulia community.
