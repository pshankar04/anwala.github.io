Codementor Weekly Newsletter - April 25, 2018

Hi puneet,

We're fashionably late, but for good reason since it's Product Hunt Launch Day! Be sure to pop over and say hi ðŸ˜€ Some other equally exciting things that happened this week include comparing in-house and freelance dev teams, how to hack your way to becoming an Indie Hacker, and dinosaurs.

No more wondering if you're over- or undercharging as a freelance developer
At least, not if you're using Freelance Developer Rate Finder, which we just launched on Product Hunt. We surveyed and analyzed the hourly rates of 9,000+ vetted freelancers across 20+ tech stacks. Better yet? You can filter rates based on experience level and location.

Seriously, what are you waiting for? Come join our launch party on Product Hunt! ðŸŽ‰
