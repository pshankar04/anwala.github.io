For a team with Jalen Hurts and Tua Tagovailoa, the Alabama Crimson Tide are strangely focused on adding a quarterback to the roster.
On Sunday, reports surfaced that coach Nick Saban and his staff would be pursuing a graduate transfer from the American Athletic Conference.
According to Matt Zenitz of AL.com, the Tide are pursuing East Carolina QB Gardner Minshew, who has experience at the FBS level:
Alabama is pursuing East Carolina grad transfer QB Gardner Minshew, per sources. He’s expected to visit Alabama at some point soon. Threw for 1,486 yards and 10 touchdowns over ECU’s final four games last year https://t.co/9aVcAUw85S

Minshew appeared in 10 games last year, throwing for 2,140 yards, 16 touchdowns and seven interceptions. The Pirates, however, struggled in 2017, finishing with just a 3-9 overall record.
Minshew left ECU in January and could probably start for a lot of FBS programs, but it appears the Tide are very interested in him and we’ll have to wait to see if he ends up in Tuscaloosa in 2018.
