Hello Puneeth,

Greetings! It’s Sam Nelson from Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree program. I want to remind you that enrollment closes soon, Tuesday, April 10 at 12 p.m. PT. And, I want to share what our grads are saying about their program experience:

Norah I. - 
“This Nanodegree program helped me get five job interviews, and two job offers. If you really want to be a data scientist, this will be a great start for you.”

John E. - 
“I just finished the program this week, and I have my first interview at a data analytics company next week!”

Valentin B. - 
“Great program! Very progressive and easy to follow. It totally meets my needs because I am currently using my new skills in my current firm. Thanks Udacity team.”

This could be you! Enroll now to secure your spot.
