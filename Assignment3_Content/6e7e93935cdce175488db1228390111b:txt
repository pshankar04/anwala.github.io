adidas Copa 17.1 Firm Ground Football Boots - Core Black/White/Red
Kangaroo leather for superior touch
Copa 17.1 is designed with an upper made from soft and flexible kangaroo leather. The natural leather provides a superior touch on the ball, great comfort and better protection. An especially engineered compression tongue provides an improved and more comfortable fit. In the heel adidas has implemented X Tex, a feature that adds better lockdown and stability.
Updated Sprintframe outsole
Copa 17.1 has been fitted with an updated edition of the adidas lightweight Sprintframe outsole. Old idea, new look. The original Sprintframe outsole became hugely popular on the adidas F50, where its low profile allowing you to get close to the pitch - providing you with optimum grip and feel of the pitch. What makes it so popular is the low weight and the flexibility of the material, that provides excellent support and stability. This is especially important when doing quick turns, sharp twists and fast accelerations. A shaped Ortholite insole combined with strategically placed foam pads provides you with the ultimate level of comfort.
