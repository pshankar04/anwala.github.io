FSU's tradition of burying a piece of sod from FSU's wins over ranked teams on the road, bowl victories and in rivalry games vs. Florida and Miami dates back to a win over Georgia in 1962.
Dean Coyle Moore began the Sod Cemetery that year and it has since been maintained by local attorney and FSU booster Doug Mannheimer.
