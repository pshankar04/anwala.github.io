      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Off to the West was a searing bright line where a scrap of the day-long Victorian smoke dome had been sautered away.&nbsp; The angle of the sun gilded the tops of trees, while leaving everything else in shadow.&nbsp; It made me think of Maxfield Parrish--more specifically, the cover of the Dali's Car album, because I couldn't think of his name.&nbsp; My brain was telling me "Max Frey", also an artist, but the sky was a bit short on giant sea creatures to hang the effect on him.<br />According to my list, I was leaving the house for a very few things:&nbsp; a book on hold at the library, dog biscuits, lighter fluid, and beer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, everyone else had left their houses, too, or were on the way home.&nbsp; Earlier this month, I noticed my crowd anxiety had resurfaced some, and it was worse today.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp; It's this weird amalgam of smiling &amp; being courteous while inwardly flinching &amp; almost hating people for being in my world.&nbsp; Underlying that is a dread I've forgotten something, too many dangling plots, a "tomorrow is my Monday" depression.&nbsp; The girl at the hardware store asked if I wanted to donate to the Children's Miracle Network.&nbsp; I didn't know it involved a paper heart on the window, I signed "Jason C" and made my exit.&nbsp; The fluid, after all, was for his Zippo, for lighting my incense.&nbsp; When I walked into the liquor store I was accosted by some whiny song dragging Weezer's sunglass-wearing corpse around "in his Quiet Riot voice singing Cum On Feel the Noize"...&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; (Edit:&nbsp; Reliant K?)&nbsp; I took it as an ill omen.&nbsp; None of the beer sounded good, so I went with a Columbia Valley Gewurtztraminer.&nbsp; If I can't live in Washington, then it can live in me.<br />Saturday night I managed to traverse the Rorschach roads that led into the dark, train-blasted factories-under-bridges part of Kansas City to have Robyn Hitchcock play One Long Pair of Eyes maybe fifteen feet in front of me &amp; refer to pink wine as "lady petrol".&nbsp; Santeria candles flickered in multi-paned steel frame windows open on a 60 degree Winter.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;pretty much&nbsp;a pop-up show.&nbsp; When I got there, I was one of four watching the soundcheck &amp; maybe 50 arrived over all.&nbsp; Part of me was screaming "Bucket Fucking List!!" and part of me was going, I know this guy...I've hung out with this guy...how is that possible?&nbsp; In dreams?<br />This morning I had one of those dreams where I can't control my car.&nbsp; I'm trying to brake but I'm stomping on the gas, the road is newly-laid asphalt in hairpin turns, I spin into a parking lot hoping to make it look like a James Bond parking in reverse stunt, my mom points out a cop, but it doesn't matter because nothing but waking up is stopping this car.&nbsp; I do wake up.&nbsp; And as soon as I close my eyes, I'm in the car again, but I'm in Heidelberg.<br />No--get up.&nbsp; Let the dog out.&nbsp; It's February, the windows are open &amp; the house smells like rain.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Washing my face in the Munchen Hauptbahnhof Burger King restroom.  Staring numbly at a bush outside of Dachau.  Marveling at the variety of olives at the Viktualienmarkt.  Four legs locked in a locked shower stall.  Peeing behind a tree in a park famous for nudists.  Spicy noodles &amp; Glockenspiel.  A tiny tot in a red hammer &amp; sickle shirt.  
Empty shelving under the Reichstag.  Bullet holes &amp; scorched concrete.  Scaffolding, cranes, construction everywhere.  A British voice in a doner kebab saying, "You look shattered."
Empty windows in trackside suicide towns.  The best fucking mustard you will ever taste bought on the edge of a deserted Cubist-inspired housing project.  Sad Gypsy accordion from a pedestrian tunnel.  Searching for Vonnegut in reconstructed Dresden.  Sleeping amongst bicycles at the end of the train.  Doing sums with Turkish boys outside Essen.  Cold War cameras making Internet porn.
Korean directions in Heidelberg elevator.  Shadows in the eaves.  Family secrets tossed into the Neckar.  Smoked beer &amp; oily potatoes.  Radiant adolescents cherub-ing at the foot of the Schlossgarten.  How many steps.  How many steps.  Marianne Faithful flying over the handlebars. </span><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

Dying is what we do. From the moment we're born, sloughing off cells, filtering toxins from the environment, matador-dancing with random collisions &amp; weather systems, blood clots &amp; bullets, brain chemicals &amp; social pressures that leave us choking slowly on a noose of alcohol &amp; drugs. &nbsp;Most of the time we're like the Roadrunner--so caught up in the rush we don't see the tunnel is just paint on a rock. &nbsp;We zoom on through, oblivious of the dangers we escape. &nbsp;But sometimes we slow down enough to notice we're pushing everything that's dear to us in a wheelbarrow...on a tightrope...above a chasm of doom.<br />
<br />
2016 is shaping up to be a banner year for things slipping out of wheelbarrows. &nbsp;And I blame Lemmy. Really. &nbsp;I think, with special glasses, you can look back to Dec. 28th &amp; see him still hanging on, laughing &amp; shaking the lifeline to see who he can take with him. &nbsp;He got the guy from the Damned, right? &nbsp;And Glenn Frey to piss off the yuppies. &nbsp;But no one expects David Bowie to slip (and all who come tumbling after). &nbsp;I mean--forgive me a Lost Boys moment, but--if you were hanging on to the underside of a railroad bridge with David Bowie and he lets go, whooping joyously as he disappears into the fog, what would you do? &nbsp;See ya, used to be ya!<br />
<br />
It seems like every day the internet is telling me that someone has died. &nbsp;It's oppressive. &nbsp;It's overwhelming. &nbsp;It's...nothing new. &nbsp;It's how we do.<br />
<br />
"if you get there before i do<br />
my heart would dig a hole in the moon"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Ok, last night I was hanging out with B. and I was moping about Prince, about work, about my family's problems. &nbsp;I felt like charcoal that was only glowing because my friend was nearby. &nbsp;She asked me who else had died this year &amp; I drew a blank. &nbsp;I figured it was because I was worn out. &nbsp;So I checked Wikipedia today &amp; out of the hundreds listed, I only recognized a few. &nbsp;And most of them were old. &nbsp;When you're old, you die. &nbsp;When you're a living being of any age in this environment, you play Russian Roulette with cancer. &nbsp;Yes, you respect their passing. &nbsp;But what made them special to us, the only connection we were ever going to have with them--the art, music, film, books--is all still here. &nbsp;You know who wasn't listed? &nbsp;My stepfather. &nbsp;Any of the Brussels airport bombing victims. &nbsp;Names to go with the bodies that piled up in the Garissa University attack in Kenya. &nbsp;Those people are us. &nbsp;And I get it. &nbsp;I'm not criticizing, but reminding myself. &nbsp;The deaths of David Bowie, Prince, etc. are the endings of stories that I can read as many times as I want. &nbsp;Their art remains woven into the fabric of my life. &nbsp;I wouldn't be me without it. &nbsp;The heaviness I feel is for the people snuffed out without warning &amp; the ones who stumble through life without ever figuring out how to live. &nbsp;My own wasted days.<br />
<br />
As our personal cultural figures slip away, we should take up the thread &amp; exercise our own creativity. &nbsp;As the world falls apart around us, we should try to live deeper. &nbsp;Be kinder. &nbsp;Make connections. &nbsp;While nameless strangers are dying in situations we could find ourselves in any day, we should spend way more time with the people we love.<br />
<br />
"in the sheets<br />
the folds the crease<br />
the blankets you are underneath<br />
a whisper fills a willing ear<br />
are you mine to keep?"<br />

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>"One of these nights I may just jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby..." &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjvCGFptxgI" target="_blank">TVC15</a><br />
<br />
I used to keep a picture of David Bowie beneath my bed. &nbsp;What?, it's true. &nbsp;Sort of. &nbsp;My "bed" was the two benches and a table that folded down in the front of a little camper trailer. &nbsp;The picture was actually a scratchy vinyl copy of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_to_Station" target="_blank">Station to Station</a></i> that my cousin had acquired somehow &amp; couldn't sell. &nbsp;This was in the mountains North of San Bernardino. &nbsp;I'd been uprooted &amp; displaced. &nbsp;I was West Coast without a compass. &nbsp;Alien.<br />
<br />
I used to think David Bowie was my mom's music. &nbsp;Except, in the radio Eighties he became my music, in a way that the other "classic rock" guys who were still going couldn't manage. &nbsp;I wasn't a fan of the high-waisted pastel Serious Moonlight look, but it's a miracle I never got a tear tattooed next to my eye. &nbsp;Such is the power. &nbsp;He has always been there, the cool Uncle who knows what you're into before you do. &nbsp;You want to grow up to be just like him. &nbsp;And marry him, too, somehow. &nbsp;Marry your cool Uncle twin.<br />
<br />
I could never listen to that record, but I still have it. &nbsp;I wouldn't have been able to appreciate the melodrama &amp; depth of it back then, anyway. &nbsp;Later years would find me driving dizzy, trying to sing along on lonely trips to Joplin &amp; back. &nbsp;The road only existing as far as my headlights. &nbsp;If an asteroid were going to hit the Earth, I wanted to go out listening to this album. &nbsp;So perhaps it is inevitable that I would link <i>Station to Station</i> to [Blackstar]. &nbsp;Maybe nothing more than my own emotional connection, but they seem similarly structured, "difficult", and then there's David Bowie miming at the end of the "Lazarus" video, wearing the same diagonally-chalkstriped outfit his younger self is wearing on the back of my cd. &nbsp;Just part of the mystery he has left us.<br />
<br />
Speaking of leaving us--I am amazed at how he pulled off such a grand exit. &nbsp;I can't even manage to scare up the skeleton of a will. &nbsp;The more I think about it, the more at a loss for words I become. &nbsp;It's a record I knew he could make, without my being able to imagine what it would sound like. &nbsp;There is no pop-connection, no effort for one last hit. &nbsp;It has the surreal energy of later Scott Walker without sounding like a rip off. &nbsp;Sometimes the music &amp; vocals could be two different songs. &nbsp;The music just goes. &nbsp;There's a little pattern the saxophone repeats about three &amp; a half minutes into "’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore", getting a little higher pitched each time, until it breaks free &amp; takes me with it. &nbsp;Scrutinizing the lyrics, though, can be overwhelming. &nbsp;In their own way, they end up being as wild as the jazz behind them. &nbsp;Seriously, an entire song sung in Polari &amp; Nadsat. &nbsp;I'll still be deciphering it next year. &nbsp;Anyway, there are numerous reviews &amp; articles that say this better than I can.<br />
<br />
A couple days ago, when I had [Blackstar] on repeat &amp; had no idea what news Monday would bring, I kept asking "what is human?", and a lyric that jumped out at me was "endless faith in hopeless deeds". &nbsp;That answer works for me. &nbsp;Maybe it's that suspension of disbelief that allows love &amp; art to thrive.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>The cold feels like I've moved to Siberia. &nbsp;Every dark morning last week, I drove to work with Godflesh cranked to 13 (naturally). &nbsp;There's an unrelenting, funky pulse that often (re)animates the angry sludge of these songs. &nbsp;One of my favorites is the unfortunately-titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9RaTOTWUVA" target="_blank">Circle of Shit</a>". &nbsp;The dance it makes me do is like a film loop of Grover from Sesame Street having an epileptic fit.<br />
<br />
The stew of the week: &nbsp;Godflesh, David Bowie, <i>The Hateful Eight</i>, <i><a href="http://comicbookroundup.com/comic-books/reviews/avatar-press/providence" target="_blank">Providence</a></i>, <i><a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/releases/nameless-1" target="_blank">Nameless</a></i>, my own weird dreams, the "news" of the world, all bubbling in the mix. &nbsp;<i>Space Oddity</i> through <i>Ziggy</i>, anticipating [Blackstar]. &nbsp;Dialogue &amp; death in a widescreen blizzard. &nbsp;Madness induced by unpronounceable Lovecraftian demons. &nbsp;All preferable to another day at the Skin Factory. &nbsp;My job is turning me into an asshole.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://chaishaikc.com/" target="_blank">Chai Shai</a> &amp; <a href="https://drafthouse.com/kansas-city" target="_blank">Alamo Drafthouse</a> with JMC. &nbsp;An unhurried pakora curry with a mysterious salty, pickled, stemmed lump that I should ask for two of next time. &nbsp;A 20-something woman to my right baby-talking to her boyfriend throughout their meal. &nbsp;I took a deep breath &amp; imagined she was a Manga character. &nbsp;The couple who replaced them held hands &amp; prayed out loud over their food, then commenced an "honest" conversation about their relationship. &nbsp;They seemed to be new to each other. &nbsp;I was struck by how beautifully cultish their public praying was to me. &nbsp;I think I've finally gotten over the childhood trauma of Midwestern cross-wielding psychos, and I can accept Christianity as being just as valid as any other religion.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed <i>The Hateful Eight</i> as much as any Tarantino film. &nbsp;I have a sort of pact with the ghost of a friend, this is what I'd be doing if you were still here. &nbsp;But amidst all the casual elbows-to-the-face, human beings reduced to splattered gore, and copious use of the word "nigger", I have to ask myself why. &nbsp;Especially, when a young black man is setting my beer down in front of me at the exact moment the word is eliciting laughter from the audience. &nbsp;I was mortified &amp; felt like running from the theater, screaming "black lives matter!" &nbsp;I want art to provoke an emotional response, questioning, reevaluation, etc., so...there you go, am I part of the problem or the solution, or both? &nbsp;The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdlMXLPfGh4" target="_blank">score</a> is good. &nbsp;The bit with the door is hilarious. &nbsp;I like how "pocket universe" it all seems--three hours of these characters isolated by a blizzard in a shack in Wyoming. &nbsp;The closeness of it makes me think of Sartre's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit" target="_blank">No Exit</a></i>.<br />
<br />
"What is human?" &nbsp;It's a question that repeats in issue four of <i>Nameless</i>. &nbsp;As the demon/alien takes away limbs, eyes, sex, dignity; &nbsp;as it drives people to rape &amp; murder; &nbsp;as our bodies are digested &amp; become worms' bodies. "What is human?" as I read of a certain "presidential candidate" urging his supporters to strip protesters of their coats before throwing them out in the cold. Seeing his claim that he's a victim of hatred, rather than an instigator, I feel the disgust grow in me, knowing he's going to get away with it. &nbsp;"What is human?" as North Korea pretends (or not) to have a hydrogen bomb, and daily shootings have made going to a restaurant an act of courage. &nbsp;The terrorists &amp; Trumpies are a cancer popping up on an overpopulated, polluted Earth where all the resources are being perverted &amp; misappropriated by a handful of people. &nbsp;Every time I turn on the news, I think "gotta make way for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBQ-S6njQQw" target="_blank">Homo Superior</a>!"<br />
<br />
On the flip side, Berkley Breathed's new <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/berkeleybreathed" target="_blank">Bloom County</a></i> is a wondrous thing. &nbsp;Neil Gaiman's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BAQso4sP4Vq/?taken-by=neilhimself" target="_blank">baby</a> is super cute. &nbsp;And a flock of starlings are squabbling on my lawn, sounding like rain when they all take off at once.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>

I've passed that burned-out house. &nbsp;It<br />

20. Who do you miss most? <br />
J or myself. &nbsp;It's hard to say which one.<br />

Driving through cottonwood fluff at not-quite warp speed.<br />
Clouds on the horizon like frozen explosions.<br />

<br />
It's quiet here in the Summer, relatively so. &nbsp;When "the students are in town" there appears to be a highway three blocks from me, which I guess is true: &nbsp;a highway that becomes a regular road while passing through &amp; turns back into a highway as it wanders West. &nbsp;There's a constant rumble of traffic that makes me think of Montag hobbling across the street in Fahrenheit 451. &nbsp;It bewilders me that so many people would be out driving in the evening. &nbsp;But tonight the cars are isolated. &nbsp;They punctuate the sound of the neighbor's air unit, a dog barking, tree frogs. <br />
Lately, I've been hearing what the Great Internet tells me is a Barred Owl: &nbsp;hoo-hoo-hoo-hoowurrl. &nbsp;It's pretty cool, if you aren't a squirrel or a rabbit. &nbsp;I stand in the back yard, watching a single bat looping across the dimming sky, wishing it would help itself to the mosquitoes trying to land on my face. &nbsp;The air is humid, but not enough to draw out more than a few lightning bugs. &nbsp;Imagine if a part of your body were to phosphoresce in relation to your desire for company. &nbsp;Would we view lonely people as beautiful, or freakish? &nbsp;How many people never meet because we can't see each other glowing? <br />
The dark treetops are barely moving, framing a smudge of cloud like something badly erased. &nbsp;I feel a sort of suspension of time, which I long for, but which also frightens me. &nbsp;We created the clock &amp; calendar. &nbsp;We sized up &amp; marked off our lives in days and hours &amp; grains of sand. &nbsp;But what happens to time when you aren't expected to be anywhere or do anything, when your main activity is to breathe in &amp; breathe out? &nbsp;If you halve the distance between two points, then halve the new distance, and again, again, etc., the two points will always get closer, but never touch because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wt3eEBKa_no" target="_blank">the space between</a> is only ever partially closed. &nbsp;The half leaves a hole, so to speak. &nbsp;And so, this moment. &nbsp;Inhaling the night, seconds into milliseconds into micro- into nano-...an eternal existence in the gully of a Temporal Grand Canyon. &nbsp;I don't want my life to be ticking clocks, but water flowing over mossy rocks. <br />
Getting older seems to be a weird combination of accretion &amp; erosion. &nbsp;I'm wearing out skins before I ever get comfortable in them. &nbsp;I'm dragging around a few barnacled husks, looking for a talented tailor. &nbsp;"Oi, Savile Row! &nbsp;'Ow much for a metaphysical niptuck?" &nbsp;"Erm...Sir, is this a Monkee or a Bunnyman?" <br />
I have a recurring dream-situation, in which I'm driving a car, but there's always a problem--I'm in the back or passenger seat, straining to operate the pedals, I'm driving backwards, the road is so steep the car goes airborne. &nbsp;It's comically obvious I feel I'm bungling this journey. &nbsp;But I'm suddenly curious what my dream metaphor was before I had my license. &nbsp;Or maybe becoming a driver in real life symbolized an adult phase I was never ready for and it created a crisis. &nbsp;In which case, thanks to all of you who guilted me into getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ZIj4r6jx8" target="_blank">behind the wheel</a>.<br />
